# C Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs that I have created. Each program is designed to demonstrate a specific concept or feature of the C programming language.

## Programs

1. **Hello World** - A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This is a classic first program for anyone learning a new programming language.

2. **FizzBuzz** - A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five it prints "Buzz". This is a popular coding interview question.

3. **Factorial** - A program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

4. **Prime Number** - A program that checks if a given number is a prime number or not.

5. **Palindrome** - A program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (a word that reads the same backwards as forwards).

6. **Guessing Game** - A simple guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.

7. **Calculator** - A basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

8. **Fibonacci Series** - A program that generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.

## How to Run

Each program can be compiled and run using the GCC compiler. For example, to run the Hello World program, use the following command:

```
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
./hello_world
```

Make sure to replace "hello_world.c" with the name of the program you want to run.
